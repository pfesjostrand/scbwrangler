Description: Collection of functions for wrangling data from SCB (Swedish Statistics). Based on what
    I repeatedly need to do myself. Currently loads directories with .px and .csv files, translate 
    variable names into English (or any other language you can define a custom dictionary) reclass 
    variables based on a definable "dictionary". Planning to add more built-in validation and some
    functions for common mutations. This is a early work, I do not really recommend using it now.
